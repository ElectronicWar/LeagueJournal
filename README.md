# League Journal
A small web application to keep track of your League of Legends games.
Make notes what happened, what's good, what's bad, where to improve.
Keep track of your progress and get a few stats out of it as well.

* [MDL](http://www.getmdl.io/) or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Some server-side scripting, most likely PHP
* Database backend (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
